This mod should be installed alongisde Litematica.

- `schematicEditReplaceSelection`: Copies the selected area(s) from the world into the litematic. This is useful for telling Litematica that an area is correct.

  - Prevent easy place from placing blocks where it shouldn't.
- Fixes an [incompatibility](https://github.com/AmyMialeeMods/visible-barriers/issues/22) with [Visible Barriers](https://modrinth.com/mod/visiblebarriers).

You can install Litemoretica on the server for additional features. This does *not* require Litematica on the server, but *does* require it on the client.
- Easy place protocol version 3. Correct placement of more blocks than version 2, such as hoppers and buttons.
- Fast and accurate pasting of schematics in multiplayer
